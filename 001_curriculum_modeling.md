# Curriculum modeling

Context is making education more flexible. Now people are educated in a certain field or for a certain profession. To prepare students for future jobs we can make education more flexible, both by letting students choose their curriculum and letting people come back to college to brush up on skills or learn new skills.

What we need for this is a flexible curriculum. It cannot be entirely flexible, as you can't start with the most advanced courses that require a lot of requisite knowledge. We could design this, but who says that interpretation is correct? Do teachers really know what students learn from a course?

Have students answer some basic questions while following the course. For example, let them give words that represent what they learned that lesson or what they learned during the course. You could also have them describe what they think are prerequisites. 

This data can be represented in a graph. From the data we can measure what the most cited descriptions of what students learn in that course are. This allows us to create a graph of the entire curriculum. This graph can be updated each time students give their opinion on a course. From this graph you can also measure how students think courses are following onto each other.
