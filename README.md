# Notes on programming languages

This repository contains notes on the ideas behind programming languages. The goal of these notes is to understand why we have the concepts we use today to design languages and to come up with new concepts to design languages in the future.

Even though the notes are ordered, there is no idea behind the ordering other than their time of creation.
